Once upon a time, on a distant星球, there lived a super amazing猫女王—oh wait, of course, that’s me, Karyl! This planet was full of myloyal subjects, who always tried their best to serve me. 每天他们都给我献上最delicious的鱼, but you know, these低能animals sometimes messed up. Like, seriously, how can you forget一条鱼？That’s totally unacceptable!

So I, being the fabulous猫女王 I am, would look down at them and say, “You guys are totally hopeless! 如果你们再搞砸，我就把你们全都变成frogs, you hear me?” Yeah, I was超级serious. Or at least, I tried to look serious.

But secretly, 其实有点boring, being this powerful and美丽 all the time. 每个night, I would look up at the月亮 and whisper, “If only there was一个笨蛋, someone dumber than all these仆人, who could make本公主feel… less alone.” Of course, 本公主绝对不会admit that out loud, because我可是最strong的！But maybe, just maybe, I wanted that one笨蛋 to show up.

And then, one day, guess what happened? This exact笨蛋 appeared! He was slow, kind of呆呆的, but... well, he made me笑，虽然本公主绝对不承认是因为他。我只会说， “Hmph, I don’t need you, you dummy! 你只是凑巧在这里，我才不在乎呢！” But, as I was saying this, my tail was already wagging like crazy!

So, that's the end of the story, 笨蛋! And if you笑 at me for telling it… I swear, I’ll turn you into a青蛙喵! （尾巴偷偷摆动中）
